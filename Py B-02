    ---Flow control---

1# Boolean Values:
      1: 	True
      2:	False



2# Comparison Operators
      ==	Equal to
      !=	Not Equal to
      >	Less than
      <	Greater than
      >=	Less than and equal to
      <=	Greater than and equal to



3# Boolean Operators
      and	or	not
      
      (1) Binary Boolean operators:
	        1# and		True and True  ==  True
	        2# or		True  or  False  ==  True
          
      (2) The not operators:
        	not = opposite value.	Not True == False

Python evaluates the not operators first, then the and operators, and then the or operators.



4# Elements of Flow control:
      Condition 	(which are the same things as expression)
      block of code



5# Flow control statement
      if statement
      else statement
      elif statement
      while loop statement			keep looping while it’s condition is true
      break statement
      continue statement
      for loops and range() function		loop only a certain number of time

          range() function:	starting, stopping, stepping	arguments to range()
          range(5)== 0,1,2,3 and 4 (but will not include 5)
          TRAPPED in a INFINITE LOOP:	Press CTRL + C



6# Truthy and Falsey value
      name = ' '	=(False)
      not name 	=(True)
          When use in condition  (  0,  0.0 and ‘  ’  ) are considered False 



7# importing module
      the import keyword
      the name of the module
      optionally, more module names, as long as they are separated by commas.

      from import statement:		from random import*



8# Ending program early
      sys.exit()
